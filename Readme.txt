# Project - Bike-share Predict

Bike-sharing predict is a neural network that is trained on an already existing dataset of bike-sharing trends for a certain bike-sharing company in Washington between 2011 and 2012 in order to come up with a prediction for the company on the total number of potential bike users so as to optimize the number of bikes distributed by the bike-sharing service.

This is the first course of the Udacity deep learning nanodegree.
